#### Used language or Framework
 - Typescript & Angular




[] What language you picked and why?
> For this project, I have decided to use Angular, version 10. I chose Angular because Angular uses simplified and elegant MVC architecture for development; also it allows you to use CLI where you can generate services, components, modules and its fast because itâ€™s single page application. Also, when you generate new Angular project almost everything is set it up for you; which allows you a swift development. Another prime reason why I chose Angular is that, Angular has a large community support and extensive documentation where you can find all the necessary information very quickly.  I could have chosen React, but I thought it would overkill for a small project like and also I have used Angular many times in the past for different projects.
##### Your process for verifying the correctness of you program
> Mainly, I have used console logs and browser developer tools in order to debug and see if there is any issue(s) or error(s) in my code, but I am sure this is not the best way to verify the correctness of your program, but at this time, my knowledge about testing frameworks such as Jest, Jasmine or Mocha is limited.  
##### What didn't you get to, or what else might you do with more time?
> N/A
